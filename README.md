## huggingface_food_not_food_text_classification_demo

This project demonstrates the application of Hugging Face's Transformers library to perform text classification tasks. Utilizing a pretrained model (distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased), the project showcases the process of fine-tuning on a custom dataset, evaluating performance, and deploying the model for inference.
